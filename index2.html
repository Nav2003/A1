<h1> Personal Information </h1>
<p> My name is Navdeep Singh Ghuman, I prefer to be called Nav. My student number is s3944633 and my personal email address is navdeepsingh20032063@gmail.com. I was born and raised in India and came to Australia permanently in late 2015 to continue studying. I come from the northern side of India, called Punjab. At home the most spoken language would be Punjabi. Growing up I always wanted to be a part of aviation, being a pilot in either the air force or being a commercial pilot for any airline company. But one day in my elective class, I was taught coding (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), ever since I have fallen in love with coding and amazingly how it runs our computers and technology overall. In my free time I like to hit up the gym, play a lot of Basketball, perform Muay Thai and boxing. Another interesting fact about me would be that I use to be a Sue Chef in a professional restaurant, working under my mother who was a Head Chef in that workplace </p>

<h2> <b> Intrets in IT </b> </h2>
<p> <font face="Arial Black"> My interest in IT is software engineering, learning how to create and run software. My interest in IT started in an elective class in year 10 where I learned basic coding languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A teacher by name of Diego Hazikosta is an individual who I will never forget as he was the man who sparked my interest in IT. I have fair bit of experience in coding languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as those were the languages I learnt during my elective in year 10. This is due to RMIT being an extremely good university regarding technology. Whenever anything to do with Information Technology comes up, the conversation cannot end without mentioning RMIT. My friends who attended/attend RMIT recommended RMIT if I desired to do a degree regarding technology. Additionally, he campus in City was extremely close and easy to get to. Lastly, a lot of close friends who I graduated with were going to RMIT. I anticipate to gain experience and learn various aspects in the Information Technology industry. I expect to learn what it takes to step into the Technology world and how it is to manage and make your way around the Technology industry.  Having the ability to do different subjects in my course allows me to step into unusual aspect of the IT world and experience it well. </p>


<h3> <b> Ideal Job </b> </h3>
<p> Job Title and Description</p>
<p> Looking at the knowledge and experience the job requires, the HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge, it appeals to me as a fair amount of experience and understanding of the three programming languages.  Secondly, as I love working in an environment where there is a great amount of collaborative work, I think this job is even more appealing to me. </p>
